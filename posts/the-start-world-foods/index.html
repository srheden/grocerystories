    <div class="content">
      <p>A good grocery store tells you something about the community in which it’s situated. Every shop carries a version of the basics: fresh produce, grains, soft drinks, canned goods, and snacks. But maybe the owners are Lebanese or Korean or Indian and so you’ll find, based on their cultural and culinary backgrounds, goods the owners see as essential on the shelves as well. At the same time, owners stock their stores according to the needs and desires of people who live in the vicinity. It’s this, the stories these products tell about the backgrounds and tastes of neighbourhood residents, that draws me into grocery stores wherever I go.</p>

<p>Grocery stores began to pique my interest as a teenager when the local shop of my youth, Barbur Foods in SW Portland, Oregon, changed hands and the aisles transformed. I remember going into the store as a kid, hand in my dad’s big hand, for a pack of Winston cigarettes, a box of Cheerios, and a stop in front of their two “foreign food” shelves to pick up Jacob’s crackers or Keiller’s marmalade, products my dad missed from home. In 2004 the Attars, a Lebanese family, took over the shop and began to incorporate food at the heart of their culinary heritage. Suddenly, alongside the more standard American grocery store fare and the tiny selection of British imports, you could find slim glass bottles of rose water, cans of fava beans, packets of za’atar, plastic tubs of tahini, and folded lavash at what was now called Barbur World Foods.</p>

<p>These newly introduced ingredients were clearly appreciated by Middle Eastern residents of the neighbourhood, but they were mysterious to me. I hadn’t heard of lavash and I didn’t know a rose – or its water, whatever that meant – was edible. I could smell, though, and I could tell that whatever lemony, cheesy ingredients deli staff were putting on flatbread and sliding into the oven was something I wanted to eat. So, I got one and learned from the deli guy that the lemony part was za’atar and that I should try baba ghanouj if I liked hummus, and why not try the mujadara too? I did and in so doing I began to understand Lebanese flavours and what I could make with the ingredients on the shelves.</p>

<p>Go into Barbur World Foods today and you’ll still learn about the Attars, you may even run into John Attar expounding on the great Lebanese wines they stock. Go there today and you’ll be able to see how the community and its tastes have changed. Go into Barbur World Foods today and pick up a pillowcase-sized lavash, some cucumbers, and a quart of Mirna Attar’s hummus for me. It’s a grocery store, like most of them, worth visiting and with a story to tell.</p>
