      <description>Hakan Aktaş’s smile and the fruit and vegetables he picks up five nights a week from New Spitalfields Market are what keep people shopping at his greengrocers, Paradise Garden. There’s a Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local across the street, and yet Paradise Garden persists and has done so for six years now.
Hakan comes from Karahasanuşağı Köyü, a predominantly Kurdish community in Elbistan, Turkey. A river cuts through the eastern side of Karahasanuşağı Köyü, a valley town with a small forest and some agricultural land and mountains in the distance.</description>

      <description>Grocery stores began to pique my interest as a teenager when the local shop of my youth, Barbur Foods in SW Portland, Oregon, changed hands and the aisles transformed. I remember going into the store as a kid, hand in my dad’s big hand, for a pack of Winston cigarettes, a box of Cheerios, and a stop in front of their two “foreign food” shelves to pick up Jacob’s crackers or Keiller’s marmalade, products my dad missed from home.</description>
