      <description>While at university in 2012, my friend Daniella and I started a blog called Shitty Photos of OK Food. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that makes me smile on there, but it&amp;rsquo;s the documented experience of cooking regularly and sometimes competitively with a great friend that I&amp;rsquo;m especially glad to have.
Chocolate beetroot cake really caught my attention that year, and has done ever since. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, let me tell you: chocolate and beets combined are delicious.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Saturday in May. Find yourself in Portland, Oregon at the PSU Farmers Market. Stop by Groundwork Organics&amp;rsquo;s stall and, casting aside the umbrella you thought would be necessary for visiting this city, buy as many sugar snap peas as you can carry. Pick a tree to lean on and crack open the peas, delight at the snapping and occasional pea popping, and eat the pods whole.
A time may come when you feel like eating something other than sugar snap peas alone.</description>

      <description>I like to make notes in my cookbooks to remind myself of what went right and wrong with the recipe. Lower heat next time. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the baking powder! Even better the day after. After I&amp;rsquo;ve made a recipe a number of times or generally feel I&amp;rsquo;ve got the hang of it, I just put a tick beside the title. My pages of Rachel Roddy&amp;rsquo;s Five Quarters: Recipes and Notes from A Kitchen in Rome are full of tick marks and pasticcini di mandorle — soft almond biscuits — has six of them.</description>
