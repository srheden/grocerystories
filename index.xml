      <description>A good grocery store tells you something about the community in which it’s situated. Every shop carries a version of the basics: fresh produce, grains, soft drinks, canned goods, and snacks. But maybe the owners are Lebanese or Korean or Indian and so you’ll find, based on their cultural and culinary backgrounds, goods the owners see as essential on the shelves as well. At the same time, owners stock their stores according to the needs and desires of people who live in the vicinity.</description>

      <description>Hello. I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah Eden. Grocery Stories is about community and food. It started out mostly about grocery stores — places I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested ever since shopping at and then working in a family-run Lebanese grocery store as a teenager — but then it grew because getting the ingredients is only the middle.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find stories here about the people, stores, cafés, and restaurants I love most, in London and in places I visit.</description>
