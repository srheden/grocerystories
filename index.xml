      <description>I watched a TV show as a kid that featured a monk happily making bread, folding and kneading away in his black robe, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a quest to make good bread myself ever since. That quest involved a lot of reading and failed attempts at home before I finally sought the help of professionals.
With a lot of classes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, I managed to make an OK loaf on the day, but then failed when trying to follow the whole process at home.</description>

      <description>I like to make notes in my cookbooks to remind myself of what went right and wrong with the recipe. Lower heat next time. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the baking powder! Even better the day after. After I&amp;rsquo;ve made a recipe a number of times or generally feel I&amp;rsquo;ve got the hang of it, I just put a tick beside the title. My pages of Rachel Roddy&amp;rsquo;s Five Quarters: Recipes and Notes from A Kitchen in Rome are full of tick marks and pasticcini di mandorle — soft almond biscuits — has six of them.</description>

      <description>Hello. I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah Eden. Grocery Stories is about community and food. It started out mostly about grocery stores — places I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested ever since shopping at and working in a family-run Lebanese grocery store as a teenager — but then it grew because getting the ingredients is only the middle.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find stories here about the people, stores, cafés, and restaurants I love most, in London and in places I visit.</description>

      <title>A Grocery Story</title>

      <description>Grocery stores began to pique my interest as a teenager when the local shop of my youth, Barbur Foods in SW Portland, Oregon, changed hands and the aisles transformed. I remember going into the store as a kid, hand in my dad’s big hand, for a pack of Winston cigarettes, a box of Cheerios, and a stop in front of their two “foreign food” shelves to pick up Jacob’s crackers or Keiller’s marmalade, products my dad missed from home.</description>
