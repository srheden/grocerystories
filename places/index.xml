      <description>I watched a TV show as a kid that featured a monk happily making bread, folding and kneading away in his black robe, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a quest to make good bread myself ever since. That quest involved a lot of reading and failed attempts at home before I finally sought the help of professionals.
With a lot of classes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, I managed to make an OK loaf on the day, but then failed when trying to follow the whole process at home.</description>

      <description>Grocery stores began to pique my interest as a teenager when the local shop of my youth, Barbur Foods in SW Portland, Oregon, changed hands and the aisles transformed. I remember going into the store as a kid, hand in my dad’s big hand, for a pack of Winston cigarettes, a box of Cheerios, and a stop in front of their two “foreign food” shelves to pick up Jacob’s crackers or Keiller’s marmalade, products my dad missed from home.</description>
