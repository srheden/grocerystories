      <description>January and February are hard months for me, and probably for some of you too. My father died last May. This fact has been making difficult experiences I&amp;rsquo;d normally find easy and making harder those which I&amp;rsquo;d have found hard at any point in my life.
So, it&amp;rsquo;s a time of sadness and here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing all the same:
 walking and generally exercising as much as I can; talking to people I love; thinking about all I have to be grateful for; and making what feels good to eat.</description>

      <description>While at university in 2012, my friend Daniella and I started a blog called Shitty Photos of OK Food. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that makes me smile on there, but it&amp;rsquo;s the documented experience of cooking regularly and sometimes competitively with a great friend that I&amp;rsquo;m especially glad to have.
Chocolate beetroot cake really caught my attention that year, and has done ever since. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, let me tell you: chocolate and beets combined are delicious.</description>
