      <description>I watched a TV show as a kid that featured a monk happily making bread, folding and kneading away in his black robe, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a quest to make good bread myself ever since. That quest involved a lot of reading and failed attempts at home before I finally sought the help of professionals.
With a lot of classes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, I managed to make an OK loaf on the day, but then failed when trying to follow the whole process at home.</description>
