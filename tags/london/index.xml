      <title>Paradise Garden</title>

      <description>Hakan Aktaş’s smile and the fruit and vegetables he picks up five nights a week from New Spitalfields Market are what keep people shopping at his greengrocers, Paradise Garden. There’s a Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local across the street, and yet Paradise Garden persists and has done so for six years now.
Hakan comes from Karahasanuşağı Köyü, a predominantly Kurdish community in Elbistan, Turkey. A river cuts through the eastern side of Karahasanuşağı Köyü, a valley town with a small forest and some agricultural land and mountains in the distance.</description>

      <description>If you find a finer selection of local and global produce in North London, let me know. I&amp;rsquo;ve found white asparagus, golden kiwis, purple yams, green almonds, and red gooseberries in Newington Green — and that&amp;rsquo;s only the produce with colours in their names. The shop is always bustling, thus the turnover is high and the fruit and veg you come home with is always fresh.</description>

      <description>Two to three times a month I walk, tube, walk, run (through a pigeon-filled tunnel), and walk to Puntarelle &amp;amp; Co (formally John &amp;amp; Elena Fruit &amp;amp; Veg). This takes me, round trip, about 2.5 hours, but I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining. For rarely more than a tenner, I come away with some of the best British and Italian produce you can buy in London.
Puntarelle &amp;amp; Co is open to the public on Saturdays, from early morning to around 2pm.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d never seen a store like Yildiz until I moved to London. You pass by piles of flat peaches, pomegranates, crook cucumbers, and cantaloupes — and before you know it you find yourself pulled into the the shop and surrounded by mountains of grains, dozens of types of halva, and fresh olives, cheese, nuts, and bread. On the topic of bread, a lot of Yildiz&amp;rsquo;s comes from their bakery next door, a bakery where you can get the finest gözleme in London for £2.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve had Radio Alice pizza (or pizza from their sister pizzerias in Italy at Berberè), you&amp;rsquo;ll already have asked yourself the question, &amp;lsquo;how do they make it so good?&amp;rsquo; Learn the answer to this question, enjoy pizza and wine on the day, and take home a starter to practice at home &amp;ndash; all for a steal at £15. Find out when their next masterclass is on here.</description>
