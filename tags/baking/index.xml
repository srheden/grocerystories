      <description>I watched a TV show as a kid that featured a monk happily making bread, folding and kneading away in his black robe, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a quest to make good bread myself ever since. That quest involved a lot of reading and failed attempts at home before I finally sought the help of professionals.
With a lot of classes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, I managed to make an OK loaf on the day, but then failed when trying to follow the whole process at home.</description>

      <description>I like to make notes in my cookbooks to remind myself of what went right and wrong with the recipe. Lower heat next time. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the baking powder! Even better the day after. After I&amp;rsquo;ve made a recipe a number of times or generally feel I&amp;rsquo;ve got the hang of it, I just put a tick beside the title. My pages of Rachel Roddy&amp;rsquo;s Five Quarters: Recipes and Notes from A Kitchen in Rome are full of tick marks and pasticcini di mandorle — soft almond biscuits — has six of them.</description>
